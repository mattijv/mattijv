### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer, mostly working on interwebs related things.

During the day I'm a mild-mannered [Magento 2](https://github.com/magento/magento2)
developer. During the night I don a cape and work on side projects I personally
find interesting or useful.

Recently I participated in the [Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020) with
[ALUS](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020/rate/696947).

I have a <a href="https://www.maybevain.com">![image with the text "website"](assets/website.svg)</a>
where I sometimes write about stuff, or link things that I find interesting and want to
remember later.
